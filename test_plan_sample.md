# Test Plan â€“ Campus Management System (Sample)

## 1. Project Overview
The Campus Management System is a web-based application for managing admissions, student records, courses, fees, hostel, and placement modules. The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the application functions correctly, reliably, and meets user requirements.

## 2. Scope
- **In scope:** Functional testing of admission, student, course, fees, hostel, and placement modules; API validation; login and user management.
- **Out of scope:** Performance testing, security testing (to be handled in separate cycles).

## 3. Objectives
- Verify that all modules function as expected.
- Identify defects and report them to development.
- Ensure data integrity and accurate user workflows.
- Validate API endpoints for expected responses.

## 4. Test Types
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- Integration Testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- API Testing

## 5. Responsibilities
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| QA Tester | Execute test cases, log defects, validate bug fixes |
| Test Lead / QA Manager | Review test cases, monitor test execution, coordinate with developers |
| Developer | Fix reported defects, clarify requirements |
| Stakeholders | Review UAT feedback and approve releases |

## 6. Risks
- Incomplete or changing requirements may delay testing.
- Dependencies on third-party APIs may cause test failures.
- Data inconsistency between modules could affect validation results.

## 7. Tools
- Jira (Defect Tracking)
- Postman (API Testing)
- SQL (Data Validation)
- QTP/UFT (Automation Testing)

## 8. Deliverables
- Test cases
- Defect reports
- Test execution summary
- Final QA sign-off document
